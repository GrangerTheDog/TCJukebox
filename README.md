TCJukebox allows you to add On-Ride synced music!

**Features**

* Synced, thanks to the show system in MCJukebox, all players in the train hear the same thing at the same time.
* Easy to use, just put down a Sign with the URL.

**Permissions**

* *tcjukebox.build* - Allows a player to build a TCJukebox sign

**Music Signs
**
To play music to the players on the train, you only have to place a sign with this format,
    [train]
    tcjukebox
    (URL)
    (continue URL)
(If your URL is too long, consider using a URL shortener like [bit.ly]('https://bit.ly')),

To stop playing music to the player on the train, place a sign with.
    [train]
    tcjukebox
    stop
    



**Dependencies:**

* [MCjukebox]('https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mcjukebox.16024/')
* [Traincarts]('https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/traincarts.39592/')



Currently, the plugin only provides basic sign support. I am planning to support Remote signs and Redstone inputs in the future!
