[B]Music Signs
[/B]
To play music to the players on the train, you only have to place a sign with this format,
[code][train]
tcjukebox
(URL)
(continue URL)[/code]
(If your URL is too long, consider using a URL shortener like [URL='https://bit.ly']bit.ly[/URL]),

To stop playing music to the player on the train, place a sign with.
[code][train]
tcjukebox
stop
[/code]

Currently, the plugin only provides basic sign support. I am planning to support Remote signs and Redstone inputs in the future!
